BLE_mbed_Remote
===============

Android App for interacting with the Nordic Semiconductor nRF51822 mbed KIT using the UART Service. Demonstrates using a slider and a switch to control the intensity and on/off state of LED2 on the nRF51822 board.

Provides the Android Studio project files containing a modified version of the the nRF UART android App to include a slider switch that turns LED2 on or off. The orignal nRF UART source code was obtained from https://developer.mbed.org/forum/wiki-16691-forum/topic/5134/ and an Android Studio ready version of this is available here https://github.com/bennthomsen/nRF_UART

The source code that you need to run on the nRF51822 board is available here http://developer.mbed.org/teams/UCL-IoT/code/BLE_UART_LEDControl_Echo/
